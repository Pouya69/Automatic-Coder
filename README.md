# Automatic-Coder
A speech-to-text bot that codes for you based on what you tell it to do.The output can be in Java, C++ and Python. The project is currently in early stages so I will be happy if anyone contributes to this so we can make the project better as time goes on.


# Installation


After cloning the project, install the requirements using "pip install -r requirements.txt".
NOTICE: if you get an error during the PyAudio installation use "pipwin install pyaudio"
Makes sure you have a microphone set up.


# Usage
After installing all the requirements, run coder.py


# Dictionary
There is a guide on how to use the bot. It is a .txt file that is included with the code.


As the project expands, we will add further instructions on the usage
